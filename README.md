## Instructions
### Download morphology from allsdk
   * Install [allensdk](https://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK/install.html) to download the morphology.
   ```sh
   cd codes
   jupyter-notebook download_morph.ipynb # Download the morphology
   ```

   * Calculate rotation angels for simulations.
   ```sh
   jupyter-notebook cal_rotation_angle.ipynb #calculate the rotation angle for the cell to make sure that the apical dendrites ascend toward the pia in the simulation.
   ```
   
   
     

### Run simulations

   * Install bmtk and create an enviroment(for example, we named it "bmtk_ateam"). Please follow the instructions in this [link](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/bmtk).
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/AllenInstitute/bmtk.git
    $ cd bmtk
    $ python setup.py install
     ```

   * Compile the modfiles. After installing bmtk, run 
      ```sh
      cd examples/biophys_components/mechanisms 
      nrnivmodl modfiles/ # this should create a directory x86_64
      ```
      If you have trouble in this step, make sure you have deleted "x86_84" before compling the modfiles.

   * Run simulations.

      In the folder "571654895_example", run the simulations using the following commands:
      ```
      python build_network.py
      python run_bionet.py
      ```
### Run EAP analysis:
   
   ```
   cd codes/
   jupyter-notebook EAP_analysis.ipynb
   ```
   to calculate and save extracellular action potential (EAP) of each electrode recordings for further analysis. 

In the "assets" folder, we have included the .json files and morphologies for all the models. We also included the templates for simulations, use build_network_in.py for inhibitory aspiny cells, and build_network_pc.py for excitatory spiny cells. For each cell, one needs to change parameters ROTX,ROTZ,CELLID,POPNAME, accordingly. You can find this information here:
      
```sh
cd assets/morphologies
vi human_celltypes_table.csv
```
